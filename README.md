OpenWeatherMap PHP API
======================
A php API to retrieve and parse global weather data from 
[OpenWeatherMap.org](http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org).
This library aims to normalise the provided data and remove some inconsistencies.
This library is neither maintained by OpenWeatherMap nor their official PHP API.

Installation
============
This library can be found on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/cmfcmf/openweathermap-php-api).
The recommended way to install and use this is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

    composer require "cmfcmf/openweathermap-php-api"


Example call
============
```php
<?php
use Cmfcmf\OpenWeatherMap;
use Cmfcmf\OpenWeatherMap\Exception as OWMException;

// Must point to composer's autoload file.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Language of data (try your own language here!):
$lang = 'de';

// Units (can be 'metric' or 'imperial' [default]):
$units = 'metric';

// Create OpenWeatherMap object. 
// Don't use caching (take a look into Examples/Cache.php to see how it works).
$owm = new OpenWeatherMap('YOUR-API-KEY');

try {
    $weather = $owm->getWeather('Berlin', $units, $lang);
} catch(OWMException $e) {
    echo 'OpenWeatherMap exception: ' . $e->getMessage() . ' (Code ' . $e->getCode() . ').';
} catch(\Exception $e) {
    echo 'General exception: ' . $e->getMessage() . ' (Code ' . $e->getCode() . ').';
}

echo $weather->temperature;
```
